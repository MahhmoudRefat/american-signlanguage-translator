# Sign Language
The Sign Language app is an Android application which can translate static ASL and BSL signs, such as the fingerspelling alphabet. These translated signs can be displayed to the user whilst allowing for sentences to be constructed. This app is currently a proof of concept to illustrate low-cost, freely available and offline Sign Language recognition using purely visual data.
